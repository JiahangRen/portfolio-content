        </strong>
        Hidden in a valley to the west of West Lake, surrounded by fields, temples, groves of bamboo and densely
        forested hills. Situated on 14 hectares, Amanfayun lies within walking distance of Lingyin Temple,
        founded in 326 AD, and is just six kilometres from tranquil West Lake. This Unesco World Heritage Site
        inspired the poets of old with its serene waters and countless pagodas. The resort is also only a
        20-minute scenic drive from the centre of Hangzhou, along China’s tea and silk hub, described by
        Marco Polo as “the city of heaven”. You can learn Chinese arts ranging from calligraphy and paper cutting to tea tasting, listen to
        local musicians, and enjoy informative talks on topics as varied as Buddhism and Traditional Chinese
        Medicine. Dating back to the 1800s, the two-storey Fayun Place is the cultural heart of the village,
        and also hosts complimentary afternoon tea daily.
