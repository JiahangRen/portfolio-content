        </strong>
        West Lake  is a freshwater lake in Hangzhou, China. It is divided into five sections by
        three causeways. There are numerous temples, pagodas, gardens, and natural/artificial
        islands within the lake. Gushan (孤山) is the largest natural island and three artificial
        islands: Xiaoyingzhou (小瀛洲), Huixin Pavilion (湖心亭), and Ruan Gongdun (阮公墩) stand at
        the middle of the lake. Leifeng Pagoda (雷峰塔) and Baochu Pagoda (保俶塔) are separated by
        the lake. Mirroring each other, the basic pattern of "one mountain, two towers,
        three islands, three banks, and five lakes" is formed.
