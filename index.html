                Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province in East China, is one of the more modern and prosperous cities in
                China,
                about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Shanghai. It sits at the southern end of the Grand Canal
                and is one of China's seven ancient national capitals. When Marco Polo came to Hangzhou in the 13th
                century,
                he declared it to be â€œthe most beautiful and elegant city in the world". There is a popular saying:
                "Above there is heaven, below there are Hangzhou and Suzhou. " Hangzhou's "heavenly" beauty attracts
                hundreds of thousands of tourists to its exquisite West Lake (Xi Hu) area each year to enjoy the placid
                lake,
                beautiful gardens, reflecting pools, lavish temples and lakeside teahouses.
